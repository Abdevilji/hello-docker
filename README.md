This is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates Docker usage.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```bash
node app.js
```

This will start the application and output a simple message to the console.

## Docker

You can also run this application using Docker.

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-node-app .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run my-node-app
   ```

This will start the Docker container and run the Node.js application inside it.

## Example `app.js`
